# Mac使用是locate指令时报的错误

```
WARNING: The locate database (/var/db/locate.database) does not exist.
To create the database, run the following command:

  sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist

Please be aware that the database can take some time to generate; once
the database has been created, this message will no longer appear.
```
按提示使用
```
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist

```
无效

应该使用需要执行

```
 sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb 进行库更新。

```
